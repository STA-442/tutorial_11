This week we look at model selection through the lens of model bias/variance trade-off. We look specifically at the following 3 selection methods

- Best Subsets - a more exhaustive alternative to stepwise selection
- Ridge Regression - A shrinkage method using the $L_2$ norm
- Lasso Regression - A shrinkage method using the $L_1$ norm
