This week we look at model selection through the lens of model
bias/variance trade-off. We look specifically at the following 3
selection methods

-   Best Subsets - a more exhaustive alternative to stepwise selection
-   Ridge Regression - A shrinkage method using the *L*<sub>2</sub> norm
-   Lasso Regression - A shrinkage method using the *L*<sub>1</sub> norm
